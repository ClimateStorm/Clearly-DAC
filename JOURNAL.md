## 10/6/2025 - Researched DACS  

I watched videos of teardown, looked up diy videos, read ect. I tried to get my foot in the door today so that I can actually start this project instead of procrastinating with the deadline coming up. I am also trying to learn how to read the graphs associated with how a DAC preforms and just the jargon of audio. For example, what do ohms have to do with speakers?

Edit: I started this project for grounded but that was 45 days ago and I forgot about everything I did because I didn't get very far. So I had to retrace my steps and kind of flex my creative muscles and remember what I was thinking. So today as spent relearning and getting settled about audio and DACS in general.![Screenshot 2025-10-05 203813.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njg0LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--856839888880cc11e31d9d31e8c98aaa98ba9cbd/Screenshot%202025-10-05%20203813.png)
